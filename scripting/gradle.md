In Gradle, a task represents a single piece of work that a build performs, such as compiling classes, running tests, creating JAR files, or deploying applications. Tasks are the fundamental building blocks of a Gradle build script and can be customized and extended to fit specific project needs.

Key Characteristics of Gradle Tasks
Types: Tasks can be of various types, such as DefaultTask, Copy, Exec, Test, etc. Custom task types can also be defined.
Actions: Tasks perform actions, which are units of work such as copying files or compiling code. Actions are executed when the task runs.
Dependencies: Tasks can have dependencies on other tasks, meaning one task might need to complete before another can start.
Configuration: Tasks can be configured with properties and methods to customize their behavior.
Lifecycle: Tasks can be executed during different phases of the build lifecycle, such as initialization, configuration, and execution.
