### Unit Test
Unit tests consist of testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components.The key idea behind unit testing is to test these units in isolation from the rest of the code.
Unit tests are typically written by developers. This makes it easier to identify and fix bugs early in the development process.

#### Here are some of the benefits of unit testing:

* Improved code quality: Unit tests help to ensure that the code is working as expected, which can lead to a more reliable and maintainable codebase.

* Early bug detection: Unit tests can help to identify bugs early in the development process, when they are easier and less expensive to fix.

* Refactoring confidence: When you have a good set of unit tests, you can be more confident when refactoring your code, knowing that the changes you make will not break any existing functionality.
